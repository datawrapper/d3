# d3-light.js

d3-light.js is a fork of [D3.js](https://github.com/mbostock/d3) that we use in [Datawrapper](http://datawrapper.de).

Major differences:

* only a limited set of features are included (scales)
* removed color interpolation
* added IE compatibility
* added run-time localization using globalize.js
* reduced size to 21k
