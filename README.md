# d3-light.js

d3-light.js is a fork of [D3.js](https://github.com/mbostock/d3) that we use in [Datawrapper](http://datawrapper.de).

Major differences:

* only a [limited set of features](https://github.com/datawrapper/d3-light/blob/master/src/d3-light.js) is included in the build
* removed color interpolation
* added IE compatibility
* added run-time localization using globalize.js
* reduced size to 21k
